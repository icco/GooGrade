@section MVC
This project follows the Model, View, Controller Philosophy. Views are Java
Server Pages. Models are classes containing Get and Set methods and the
ability to store data to the storage system. Controllers act with the models
and the views to do actual specific work.

@section Note
This is not complete enough to be implemented. Most of the controllers need 
more functionality and how to connect to the storage system is all but
undocumented. Also the JSP pages were excluded because they had no
documentation what so ever.

 @section Markup
 Doxygen generates <a
 href="http://validator-test.w3.org/check?uri=referer">HTML 4.01
 Transitional</a>
 documents with <a
 href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator">Cascading Style Sheets
 (CSS)</a>
 and you can include  markup tags that are compatible with those
 standards.
