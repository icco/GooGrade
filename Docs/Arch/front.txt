@section MVC
This project follows the Model, View, Controller Philosophy. Views are Java
Server Pages. Models are classes containing Get and Set methods and the
ability to store data to the storage system. Controllers act with the models
and the views to do actual specific work.

 @section Markup
 Doxygen generates <a
 href="http://validator-test.w3.org/check?uri=referer">HTML 4.01
 Transitional</a>
 documents with <a
 href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator">Cascading Style Sheets
 (CSS)</a>
 and you can include  markup tags that are compatible with those
 standards.
